# What is `RMarkdown`?

[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)

RMarkdown is a document format for use with the R programming language to combine text and code together to produce publication-quality reports,
interactive dashboards, presentations, and other outputs

# Why is `RMarkdown` cool?

- Flexibile formatting and output styles
- Easy reproducibility and rerun-ability
- Notebook-style segments to test and view plots
- Support for all of R's output styles (formatted tables, ggplot plots, plotly, shiny, etc.)

# How do I use `RMarkdown`?

## Installation
1. Install RMarkdown
```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
2. Create a new RMarkdown Document
```
File => Document => New RMarkdown Document
```
3. Change default headings etc., import data, and start using it!


# Who should use `RMarkdown`, and when?

`RMarkdown` excels when:
- You are producing reports, numbers and figures, or full publications where the input data is changing or is expected to change over time
- You are inputting many numbers by hand into a report, and would like an alternative workflow to reduce human error
- Your data is pre-processed somewhat to reduce load time and processing time
- You may be switching between output formats (HTML, Word, PDF), or want to integrate Shiny apps within a report
- You want to generate a shareable report via IHME's Shiny server.

`RMarkdown` is not the answer to your problems if:
- You want to quickly produce a one-off report or results summary
- You are trying to summarize lots of unstructured, unformatted data
- Your team workflow or report is significantly changing structure or content in a way that would make number-plugging updates difficult.
